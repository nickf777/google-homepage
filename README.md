# google-homepage
The Odin Project: Assignment 1
My current project is to recreate the HTML and CSS of the google homepage and, if possible, the search results page. 

What I learned:
- How to create a horizontal header and footer
- Problem solving of positioning items relative to one another
- Gained more experience and greater understanding about what specific CSS properties alter
- Experience with dev tools and how to use it to tweak aspects of CSS and get immediate feedback
